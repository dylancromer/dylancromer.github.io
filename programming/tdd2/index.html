<h1 id="more-realistic-testing-scenarios">More Realistic Testing Scenarios</h1>

<p>In the last part I outlined a brief description of TDD using the example of writing a function in Python that adds numpy arrays together. Of course in actual research, the problem you are trying to solve with code is usually a lot more complicated than just adding a few arrays. Usually you have a more complex calculation consisting of many steps, which might be performed on data in a processing pipeline. You might be attempting to design an analysis routine for some processed data. You might be trying to recreate a lengthy theoretical calculation. In any of these scenarios, testing will be more difficult.</p>

<p>To illustrate a more realistic case, let&rsquo;s imagine we wanted to design a class that models some data with a linear fit plus random noise, of the form
<span class="jsonly">
     
        $$y = \mathrm{slope} \times x &#43; \text{additive constant} &#43; \mathrm{noise}$$
    
</span>
<noscript>
     
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%20%3d%20%5cmathrm%7bslope%7d%20%5ctimes%20x%20%2b%20%5ctext%7badditive%20constant%7d%20%2b%20%5cmathrm%7bnoise%7d" title="y = \mathrm{slope} \times x &#43; \text{additive constant} &#43; \mathrm{noise}" />
        </div>
    
</noscript>
</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll call it <code>LinearModel</code> (by the way, it is convention in Python to use <code>snake_case</code> for functions and <code>CamelCase</code> for classes). This is in the context of wanting to integrate this class into a larger program.</p>

<p>In the last part we wrote tests that looked like this structurally:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_a_thing</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">blah_blah_blah</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we just ran these tests by calling them in the same python file. This is not a particularly good way to run tests, because you have to hard code every test failure message, and you will frequently have no idea why particular assertion failed. I suggest you use a tool like <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a>, which will autorun functions with the name &ldquo;test&rdquo; in them, and give you an output like this:</p>

<pre><code>======================= test session starts ======================
platform darwin -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-4.6.2, py-1.8.0
rootdir: /Users/dylan/Development/intro-tdd
collected 1 item

test.py F                                                    [100%]

============================ FAILURES =============================
__________________________ test_a_thing ___________________________

    def test_a_thing():
&gt;       blah_blah_blah
E       NameError: name 'blah_blah_blah' is not defined

test.py:2: NameError
==================== 1 failed in 0.06 seconds =====================

shell returned 1
</code></pre>

<p>It will also print out the values of any variables involved in a failing assertion.</p>

<p>In addition to pytest, I have begun to use an extension for pytest called <a href="https://github.com/ropez/pytest-describe">pytest-describe</a>, which changes how pytest looks for test functions. Let me write a quick test for our <code>LinearModel</code> class using pytest-describe-type test functions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">numpy</span> <span class="kn">as</span> <span class="nn">np</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">describe_linear_model</span><span class="p">():</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">describe_y</span><span class="p">():</span>

        <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">when_noise_is_zero_it_returns_a_line</span><span class="p">():</span>
            <span class="n">linear_model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">LinearModel</span><span class="p">()</span>
            <span class="n">linear_model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">additive</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
            <span class="n">linear_model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">slope</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
            <span class="n">linear_model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">noise_level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
        
            <span class="n">xs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">linspace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
        
            <span class="n">ys</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">linear_model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span>

            <span class="k">assert</span> <span class="n">np</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ys</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">xs</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here we&rsquo;ve nested the test function under two &ldquo;describe&rdquo; functions. Notice that we also don&rsquo;t need to have the word &ldquo;test&rdquo; in our functions for pytest to work. All that pytest-describe is doing here is to allow pytest to recurse through these nested describe-functions, find the actual test functions, and run them.</p>

<p>So what does this actually output?</p>

<p>This seems like a purely aesthetic change, and it is, but I find that writing tests this way undoes a certain kind of test-writer&rsquo;s block that can hit when trying to think of how to write tests for a new feature in a system. When writing a test like the one above, my workflow is something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imagine a central object to handle the job I need done (e.g. the <code>LinearModel</code> class)</li>
<li>Start a test function describing this object (e.g. <code>describe_linear_model</code>, or for methods nest deeper e.g. <code>describe_y</code>)</li>
<li>Write down a core behavior or property I think my object <em>must</em> have in order to function correctly</li>
<li>I use the name of the test function to quickly express this in compact plain-English, e.g. <code>when_noise_is_zero_it_returns_a_line</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This works well because it helps me quickly work through the process of isolating core properties the object or function needs to have, and then gives me a nearly plain-English description of these with a working example.</p>

<p>This workflow took a fair bit of time to figure out, and will undoubtedly change as I continue to refine it. Being productive with TDD doesn&rsquo;t happen immediately but requires an adjustment period of getting used to approaching a coding problem differently. There are many other testing tools available for Python alone, so if this kind of workflow isn&rsquo;t for you, don&rsquo;t be afraid to explore and experiment with other styles of TDD.</p>
