<meta name="twitter:description" content="I am Dylan Cromer. I was a cosmologist with extensive experience studying galaxy cluster masses, using a variety of statistical and computational techniques. After that, I started to focus on a personal research project about structural problems in academia that lead to abuse, poor mental health of grad students, and other problems. My goal is to eventually publish this research. I am currently looking for work; if you are interesting in hiring me for a job in data science or another field that you feel I would be suited for, please contact me at dylan@dylancromer."/>
