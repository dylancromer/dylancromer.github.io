<p>I received my undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where I worked with Professors Brian Dennison on the origin of fast radio bursts, and James Perkins on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy from silver lithographic nanoparticles.</p>

<p>Broadly my interest is in leveraging science, math, and computing for understanding the universe, and for social good. Right now I focus mostly on studying the universe, but am also interested in how the same tools can be applied in the social sciences.</p>

<p>My CV is located <a href="../pdfs/cv.pdf">here</a>.</p>
