I am currently working with Prof. Nick Battaglia on data-driven theoretical cosmology.

I received my undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where I worked with Professors Brian Dennison on the origin of fast radio bursts, and James Perkins on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy from silver lithographic nanoparticles."/>

<p>I received my undergraduate degree in physics and mathematics from the University of North Carolina at Asheville, where I worked with Professors Brian Dennison on the origin of fast radio bursts, and James Perkins on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy from silver lithographic nanoparticles.</p>

<p>In addition to cosmology, I am interested in social science, and how data-based study can inform us about the way our societies function.</p>
