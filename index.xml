      <description>More Realistic Testing Scenarios&amp;nbsp;Â¶ In the last part I outlined a brief description of TDD using the example of writing a function in Python that adds numpy arrays together. Of course in actual research, the problem you are trying to solve with code is usually a lot more complicated than just adding a few arrays. Usually you have a more complex calculation consisting of many steps, which might be performed on data in a processing pipeline.</description>

      <description>Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of writing code via creating tests, and using the tests to do design on your system. My best summary in a sentence is that TDD exists to focus the difficulty of designing programs into smaller, controllable pieces, in the form of tests.
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a more solid definition of TDD, I invite you to watch this video of Gary Bernhardt explaining it very succinctly.</description>

      <description>I am Dylan Cromer. I am a data scientist with training in cosmology, mathematics, and physics. I have experience analysing, visualizing, and modeling many different types of data. I am especially interested in the process of machine-learning model selection, testing and validation (both of software and models), and data science product QA and Product Management. I enjoy the practice of test-driven development in software, and I like to extend the logic of TDD to other domains.</description>
