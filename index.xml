      <description>More Realistic Testing Scenarios&amp;nbsp;Â¶ In the last part I outlined a brief description of TDD using the example of writing a function in Python that adds numpy arrays together. Of course in actual research, the problem you are trying to solve with code is usually a lot more complicated than just adding a few arrays. Usually you have a more complex calculation consisting of many steps, which might be performed on data in a processing pipeline.</description>

      <description>Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of writing code via creating tests, and using the tests to do design on your system. My best summary in a sentence is that TDD exists to focus the difficulty of designing programs into smaller, controllable pieces, in the form of tests.
If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a more solid definition of TDD, I invite you to watch this video of Gary Bernhardt explaining it very succinctly.</description>

      <description>I am Dylan Cromer. I was a cosmologist with extensive experience studying galaxy cluster masses, using a variety of statistical and computational techniques. After that, I started to focus on a personal research project about structural problems in academia that lead to abuse, poor mental health of grad students, and other problems. My goal is to eventually publish this research. I am currently looking for work; if you are interesting in hiring me for a job in data science or another field that you feel I would be suited for, please contact me at dylan@dylancromer.</description>
